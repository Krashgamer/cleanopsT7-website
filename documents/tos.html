        <h1>Cleanops BO3 Patch - Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: June 13, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Cleanops BO3 Patch ("the Patch"), you agree to be bound by these
            Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use the Patch.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops BO3 Patch is a community-driven modification for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Multiplayer, designed
            to enhance game stability, security, and privacy, primarily by combating cheaters and fixing exploits. It
            aims to provide a fair and fun gaming experience for its users.</p>

        <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
        <p>The Patch is provided to you free of charge for personal, non-commercial use within Call of Duty: Black Ops
            3. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Patch in accordance with
            these Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct and Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>To maintain a fair and functional environment, the use of the Patch is subject to the following rules. The
            Patch is designed to prevent individual users from abusing features or exploits, with actions like kicking
            cheaters handled through a secure database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bannable Offenses (Cheating & Malicious Actions):</strong> The following actions are strictly
                prohibited and will result in your addition to the Clean Ops blacklist and exclusion from lobbies where
                the Patch is active:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Using external cheat software (e.g., Aimbot, Wallhacks, Spinbot, No Recoil).</li>
                <li>Using game-breaking exploits, including God Mode classes.</li>
                <li>Maliciously and repeatedly crashing servers or kicking other players using exploits.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Bannable Behavior (Discouraged but Tolerated):</strong> The Patch does not police individual
                playstyles or long-standing game mechanics. The following, while potentially frustrating, are not
                grounds for a Clean Ops ban:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the in-game "Pick-10 Glitch" for modded classes.</li>
                <li>Toxic behavior such as trash-talking, insults in game chat, camping, or using "annoying" weapons.
                    Users encountering such behavior should use in-game mute functions or switch servers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>General Misuse:</strong> Any attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise tamper with
                the Patch's code, or to use the Patch for any purpose other than its intended use as described, is
                prohibited.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>To provide the anti-cheat functionality and improve the Patch, we collect limited personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steam ID (Steam Account Identifier):</strong> Used to identify players for anti-cheat purposes
                and to track usage for analytical purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):</strong> Used for network-related functions, security,
                and to prevent ban evasion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected and processed in accordance with our GDPR Policy, which provides more detailed
            information on data handling, legal basis, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>5. Reporting System</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops Patch includes an in-game reporting system to combat cheating. Users are encouraged to report
            suspected cheaters directly through the in-game user interface while in the same live match. This method
            sends crucial information directly to the Clean Ops team for verification. Reporting for reasons other than
            cheating will not result in action.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops BO3 Patch is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antivirus False Positives:</strong> Your antivirus software may flag cleanopsT7.exe or
                cleanops.dll as a threat due to the nature of game patching (e.g., downloading files, injecting DLLs,
                obfuscated code). These are false positives, and you may need to add exclusions to your antivirus for
                the Patch to function correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> The Patch is a standalone solution and conflicts with the original
                t7patch and similar mods. Running multiple such tools can cause crashes or injection failures.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Stability:</strong> While the Patch enhances stability, it cannot prevent all instances of
                server crashes or disconnections, especially those caused by malicious actors.</li>
            <li><strong>DLC Files:</strong> The Patch will not provide any game DLC files. "Spoof DLC" functionality
                only works if you already possess the necessary map files.</li>
            <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or operation of the Patch
                or its features. Issues may arise due to game updates, Steam maintenance, or other factors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops BO3 Patch, including its code, design, and associated assets, is the intellectual property of
            the Clean Ops T7 GitHub repository and its contributors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or
            lease any part of the Patch without explicit written permission.</p>

        <h2>8. Account Termination and Suspension (Bans)</h2>
        <p>Violations of these Terms, particularly engaging in cheating or malicious actions, may result in your
            permanent ban from Clean Ops-enabled lobbies. The Clean Ops ban system targets detected cheaters within the
            game's environment, regardless of whether they are using the Clean Ops Patch themselves. A Clean Ops ban
            prevents the affected player from joining or staying in matches where at least one other player is running
            the Patch ; it does not affect their Steam account or vanilla game access. Additionally, a Clean Ops ban may
            limit your access to specific community features or support channels related to the Patch, as deemed
            necessary to maintain the integrity of the community and the Patch's services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appeal Process:</strong> If you believe your ban was in error, you may appeal by creating a "Ban
                Appeal" ticket on the Clean Ops Discord Server, providing your Steam Profile URL or SteamID64, and
                politely explaining your case. Threats or demanding behavior will result in denial of appeal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Updates and Modifications</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated through our
            designated channels (e.g., Discord, GitHub Pages). Your continued use of the Patch after such modifications
            constitutes your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its
            conflict of law principles.</p>
