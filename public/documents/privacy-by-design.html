        <h1>Our Commitment to Data Protection by Design & Default</h1>
        <p>At Cleanops T7, we are committed to integrating privacy and data protection principles into the core design
            and operation of our Patch, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 25.
            This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Minimisation:</strong> We only collect personal data that is absolutely necessary for the
                stated purposes of enhancing game stability, security, and privacy, primarily your Steam ID and IP
                address. We avoid collecting superfluous information.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy-Enhancing Defaults:</strong> The Cleanops Patch is designed with privacy in mind.
                Features like IP-Spoofing are available to empower users to protect their information. While some
                features require temporary adjustment (e.g., IP-Spoofing for party invites), the intent is to provide
                robust privacy controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in Security:</strong> We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
                protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This
                includes maintaining a secure and integrity-protected cheater blacklist, which is securely distributed
                to users for automatic cheater removal.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We strive to be transparent about what data we collect, why we collect
                it, and how it is used, as detailed in our Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Review:</strong> We continuously review our data processing practices and security
                measures to ensure they remain effective and aligned with evolving privacy standards and legal
                requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our goal is to provide a fair, fun, and <em>secure</em> gaming experience, with your privacy at the forefront
            of our development philosophy.</p>
