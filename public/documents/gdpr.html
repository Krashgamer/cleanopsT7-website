        <h1>Cleanops BO3 Patch - GDPR Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: June 20, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>This document outlines the privacy practices of the Cleanops BO3 Patch ("the Patch") with regard to the
            collection, processing, and storage of personal data from its users, in compliance with the General Data
            Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops BO3 Patch processes personal data as described in this policy.<br>By using the Patch, you
            acknowledge the terms outlined herein.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of the GDPR, the data controller responsible for your personal data collected through the
            Cleanops BO3 Patch is:</p>
        <p>Krashgamer<br>privacy@cleanops.dev</p>

        <h2>3. Personal Data Collected</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops BO3 Patch collects the following types of personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steam ID (Steam Account Identifier):</strong> A unique identifier associated with your Steam
                account.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):</strong> A unique numerical label assigned to every
                device connected to a computer network. To enhance user privacy, IP addresses are pseudonymized through
                a salted SHA256 hash.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Purpose and Legal Basis for Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The personal data listed above is collected and processed for the following purposes, based on identified
            legal bases under GDPR:</p>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Analytical Purposes and Service Integrity</p>
        <p>To monitor and analyze the performance, stability, and usage patterns of the Cleanops BO3 Patch, including
            understanding user numbers, tracking adoption, and detecting technical issues or misuse. This processing
            also supports the detection and prevention of cheating or malicious activity to maintain fair gameplay and
            the integrity of the Patch.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR)</p>
        <p>We process your Steam ID and IP address to fulfill our legitimate interest in understanding how our Patch is
            used, identifying and resolving technical issues, preventing abuse, and maintaining fair gameplay. This
            processing is necessary to operate and enhance the Patch, and our interests are balanced against your
            fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your personal data (Steam ID and pseudonymized IP address) collected for the stated purposes will be retained
            for a period strictly necessary to fulfill those purposes, or as required by applicable law. This data is
            retained for a maximum of 3 days. After this period, the data will be securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We may share your personal data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party service providers to assist in operating the
                Patch and performing analytics, as well as for underlying infrastructure. These include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> Used for network performance, security, and potentially as a proxy for
                    API calls, which may involve processing IP addresses. Transfers to Cloudflare, Inc. (USA) are based
                    on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (2021/914/EU), Module 2, along with supplementary measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Oracle Cloud VM:</strong> Used for server infrastructure and data storage (e.g., databases
                    for anti-cheat and analytics). The Oracle server is based in Germany, meaning data processed via
                    this service remains within the EEA.These providers are contractually bound to process data only on
                    our behalf and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your personal data if required by law or in response
                to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries outside of the European Economic Area
            (EEA), specifically the United States, through our service provider Cloudflare. Where such transfers occur,
            appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by
            the European Commission as detailed in Section 6. As our Oracle Cloud VM server is based in Germany, data
            processed through Oracle remains within the EEA and does not constitute an international transfer for GDPR
            purposes.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Cleanops BO3 Patch is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly
            collect personal data from children under 16. If we become aware that personal data from a child under 16
            has been collected without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. If you
            are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at
            privacy@cleanops.dev.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access (Article 15 GDPR):</strong> Obtain confirmation and access to your personal
                data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification (Article 16 GDPR):</strong> Request correction of inaccurate personal
                data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten") (Article 17 GDPR):</strong> Request deletion of your
                personal data under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18 GDPR):</strong> Request restriction of processing
                under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability (Article 20 GDPR):</strong> Receive personal data in a structured,
                commonly used, and machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object (Article 21 GDPR):</strong> Object to processing based on legitimate interests.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent (Article 7(3) GDPR):</strong> Withdraw consent where processing is
                based on consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint (Article 77 GDPR):</strong> Lodge a complaint with a supervisory
                authority.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <h2>10. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against
            unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include the pseudonymization of
            data, such as hashing IP addresses with a salt.</p>

        <h2>11. Data Breach Notification</h2>
        <p>In the unlikely event of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and
            freedoms, we will make reasonable efforts to inform affected users through our designated public channels
            (e.g., Discord server, GitHub Pages) and notify the relevant supervisory authority without undue delay, in
            accordance with our legal obligations under the GDPR. We will communicate the nature of the breach, the
            likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address it.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Material changes
            will be communicated through our designated channels. Continued use of the Patch after modifications
            constitutes acknowledgment of the updated policy.</p>
